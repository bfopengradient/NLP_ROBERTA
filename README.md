 
Testing Facebook's new ROBERTA model. 

ROBERTA is Facebook's twist on Google's BERT model.

Both models are now the leaders in natural language processing/understanding tasks. 

In essence both machine learning models are the best in class at reading and understanding language. From that basis they can be fine-tuned to carry out multiple tasks including reading emails, social media content or any content input to browsers, etc.

In the attached file in this repo I tested the ROBERTA model on some sentence pairs it had not seen before. 

I use machine learning models like these to help classify content that might be helpful to risk professionals within the financial services domain, thus cutting down on the amount of time humans need to spend sifting through vast quantities of content that usually is not of interest and was usually retrieved using blunt keyword search software.
